# Day 1: Handling Imbalanced Data
Dealing with imbalanced data is a crucial step in machine learning. It poses challenges as models tend to become biased toward the majority class.

- **Understand the Data**: Analyze and identify the imbalance through visualization and descriptive statistics.
- **Resampling Techniques**: Use techniques like oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) or undersampling.
- **Algorithmic Adjustments**: Opt for ensemble methods, boosting algorithms, or algorithms designed for imbalanced datasets.
- **Class Weights**: Adjust the weights in your model to handle imbalance.

Addressing this ensures more robust and generalized model predictions.
